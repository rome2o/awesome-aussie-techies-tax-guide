# Offsetting Capital Gains with Losses ðŸ“‰

## Introduction

Offsetting capital gains with losses is a tax strategy that can help reduce your capital gains tax (CGT) liability. This section explains how to use capital losses to offset gains and the rules governing this process.

## Understanding Capital Gains and Losses

- **Capital Gains**: Profit from the sale of assets such as shares, property, or other investments.
- **Capital Losses**: Losses incurred from the sale of assets for less than their purchase price.

## How to Offset Capital Gains with Losses

1. **Calculate Capital Gains**: Determine the capital gains from the sale of assets.
2. **Calculate Capital Losses**: Identify any capital losses from the sale of other assets.
3. **Offset Gains with Losses**: Subtract capital losses from capital gains to reduce the net gain.
4. **Carry Forward Unused Losses**: Any unused capital losses can be carried forward to future tax years.

## Rules and Limitations

- **Same Financial Year**: Capital losses must be offset against capital gains in the same financial year.
- **Carry Forward Losses**: Unused capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely but cannot be offset against other income types.

## Examples

- **Example 1**: Selling shares for a $10,000 gain and offsetting it with a $5,000 loss from another investment.
- **Example 2**: Carrying forward a $3,000 loss to offset gains in future years.
