Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that can offer high returns but come with significant risk. This section covers key points to consider when investing in cryptocurrencies, along with tax implications and strategies for managing your investments. Please keep in mind this is a very volatile region.

## Understanding Cryptocurrencies üí°

- **Digital Assets**: Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security.
- **Blockchain Technology**: Most cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized blockchain technology.
- **Market Volatility**: Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate widely, offering both high risk and high reward.

### Holding Periods ‚è≥

Holding cryptocurrencies for more than 12 months can qualify you for a 50% capital gains tax (CGT) discount. See [Capital Gains Tax](capital-gains-tax.md) for more details.

- **Dates of Transactions**: When you bought and sold the cryptocurrency.
