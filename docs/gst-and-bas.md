# ðŸ’¼ GST and BAS for IT Professionals

Understanding your obligations regarding Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Business Activity Statements (BAS) is essential for managing your business finances effectively. This section covers the basics of GST registration, collection, and reporting through BAS.

## GST Registration ðŸ“‹

- **Threshold**: If your business has a GST turnover of $75,000 or more, you must register for GST. Below this threshold, registration is optional.
- **How to Register**: Register for GST through the Australian Business Register (ABR) or via the ATO's online services.

## Collecting GST ðŸ’¸

- **GST on Sales**: Charge 10% GST on most goods and services you sell.
- **Issuing Tax Invoices**: Provide tax invoices to your customers that show the amount of GST included.

## Claiming GST Credits ðŸ§¾

- **GST on Purchases**: Claim credits for the GST included in the price of goods and services you purchase for your business.
- **Record Keeping**: Keep detailed records of all business transactions to support your GST claims.

## Lodging BAS ðŸ“…

- **Frequency**: Lodge your BAS monthly, quarterly, or annually, depending on your business's turnover and reporting preferences.
- **Reporting Requirements**: Report your GST collected on sales and GST credits claimed on purchases. BAS may also include PAYG instalments, PAYG withholding, and other tax obligations.

## Example Scenario ðŸ“˜
