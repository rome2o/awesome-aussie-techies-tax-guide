## Introduction

Determining your tax residency status is essential as it affects how your income is taxed in Australia. This section explains the criteria for tax residency and the implications of being a resident or non-resident for tax purposes.

## Criteria for Tax Residency

- **Domicile Test**: If your domicile (permanent home) is in Australia, you may be considered a resident, unless your permanent place of abode is outside Australia.

## Tax Implications for Residents
