# 📈 Investment Options within Superannuation

Most super funds offer a range of investment options, from conservative to high-growth. Choosing the right investment option can significantly impact your super balance at retirement.

## Default Options

Managed by the super fund, these options are typically balanced or growth-oriented. They are designed to suit the general needs of most members and require minimal involvement from you.

## Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs) ⚖️

Provide greater control over investments but require more involvement and understanding of investment strategies and compliance. For more details, see [Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs)](self-managed-super-funds.md).
