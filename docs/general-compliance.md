## Best Practices for Record Keeping 📋

### Separate Personal and Business Finances 🔄

Maintain separate bank accounts for personal and business transactions. This helps prevent mixing personal expenses with business expenses and simplifies record-keeping.

Update your records regularly to avoid last-minute stress during tax time. Set aside time each week or month to review and organize your financial records.
